# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
A Node.js command-line application that generates a logo based on user input and saves it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to choose a color and shape, enter text for the logo, and specify the shape's color. It then creates an SVG file named `logo.svg` with the specified attributes.

## Usage
Run the application using the command `node index.js`. Follow the prompts to enter text (up to three characters), select a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and specify the colors for both the text and shape. After completing the prompts, the application will generate an SVG file named `logo.svg` and print "Generated logo.svg" to the command line.
